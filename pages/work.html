    <h1>Work</h1>
		<p>Here you can find information providing a general overview as to what the work life is like, what the experience will be like, and some of
		<br>the benefits.</p>
	<h2>Work week structure?</h2>
		<p>An apprentice will need to work a minimum of 30 hours per week including any off-the-job training you undertake. However, this does not
		<br>apply in every circumstance. For example, people with caring responsibilities or people with a disability may work reduced weekly hours.
		<br>Where this is the case, the duration of the apprenticeship will be extended to take account of this. The time spent on off-the-job 
		<br>training should be at least 20% and should be included as part of working hours. The employer must allow time to complete the 
		<br>apprenticeship within the working hours.</p>
	<h2>What can I earn as an apprentice?</h2> 
		<p>The national minimum wage (NMW) for apprentices is Â£3.90 per hour from April 2019. The apprentice NMW applies to apprentices aged under 19 or 
		<br>aged 19 or over and in the first year of their apprenticeship. Apprentices aged 25 and over, and not in the first year of their apprenticeship, 
		<br>will be entitled to the National Minimum Wage. </p>
